# **USA Baby Names Analysis**
The United States Social Security Administration (SSA) has made available data on the frequency of baby names from 1880 through the present.

There are many things you might want to do with the dataset:
- Visualize the proportion of babies given a particular name (your own, or another name) over time
- Determine the relative rank of a name
- Determine the most popular names in each year or the names whose popularity has advanced or declined the most
- Analyze trends in names: vowels, consonants, length, overall diversity, changes in spelling, first and last letters
- Analyze external sources of trends: biblical names, celebrities, demographic changes
